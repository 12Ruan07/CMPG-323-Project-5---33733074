## How to Use Report

On opening the report, the following three pages will be available for viewing: High-level Metrics, Device Monitoring, and Device Registration. Please refer to the rest of the document for more information on each page as well as the use of filtering.


*Device Monitoring:*
This page is all about monitoring the devices with the following three visualizations:
1.	Number of Devices Per Category: Can be used to see how many devices there are across all of the categories. Thus, monitoring devices per category
2.	Number of Devices Per Zone: Can be used to see how many devices there are across all of the zones. Thus, monitoring devices per category
3.	Online and Offline Devices: Depicts how many devices are offline and how many are online. Use the data legend which indicates what colour represent offline or online devices. 

*Device Registration:*
This page contains all the information about the registration of devices:
1.	Number of Device Registered Over Timespan: Displays the number of the devices that were registered over a timespan. It also visualizes how the total number of devices increase of time and the last “bar” represents the total number of devices registered for the whole time-period
2.	Number of Categories Created: This graph shows the number of categories created that belongs to the devices as they were registered.
3.	Number of Zones Containing Devices: Indicates the number of zones that contain devices over a timespan.

*Filtering:*
Filters on the report can be used across all three of the pages. Five filters were added to make it easier for the user to search for specific data:
1.	Activity Filter: Filters data on the basis that a device is active or inactive
2.	Category Filter: Filters data and shows all of the data of the selected category
3.	Date Filter: Filters data to show all the data related to the specific data a device has been installed.
4.	Device Filter: Filters data and shows all of the data of the selected device
5.	Zone Filter: Filters data and shows all of the data of the selected zones
